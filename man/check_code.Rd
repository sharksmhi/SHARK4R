\title{Check matches of reported codes in SMHI's SHARK codelist}
\usage{
check_code(
  data,
  field = "sample_project_name_sv",
  code_type = "PROJ",
  clean_cache_days = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tibble (or data.frame) containing the codes to check.}

\item{field}{Character; name of the column in \code{data} that contains the codes
to be validated against the SHARK codelist. Default is "sample_project_name_sv".}

\item{code_type}{Character; the type of code to check (e.g., "PROJ").
Defaults to \code{"PROJ"}.}

\item{clean_cache_days}{Numeric; if not \code{NULL}, cached SHARK code Excel files
older than this number of days will be automatically deleted and replaced
by a new download. Defaults to 30. Set to \code{NULL} to disable automatic cleanup.}
}
\value{
A tibble with unique reported codes and a logical column \code{match_type}
indicating if they exist in the SHARK codelist.
}
\description{
This function checks whether the codes reported in a specified column of a
dataset (e.g., project codes, ship codes, etc.) are present in the
official SHARK codelist provided by SMHI. It downloads and caches the
codelist if necessary, compares the reported values against the valid codes,
and returns a tibble showing which codes matched. Informative messages are
printed if unmatched codes are found.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link[=get_shark_codes]{get_shark_codes()}} to get the current code list.

\code{\link[=clean_shark4r_cache]{clean_shark4r_cache()}} to manually clear cached files.
