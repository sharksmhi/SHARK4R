\title{Match station names against SMHI station list}
\usage{
match_station(names, station_file = NULL, try_synonyms = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{Character vector of station names to match.}

\item{station_file}{Optional path to a custom station file (tab-delimited).
If \code{NULL} (default), the function will extract and use the bundled
\code{"station.zip"} from the \code{SHARK4R} package.}

\item{try_synonyms}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), unmatched names
are also compared against the \code{SYNONYM_NAMES} column in the database.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\describe{
\item{reported_station_name}{The input station names.}
\item{match_type}{Logical; \code{TRUE} if the station was found in the SMHI station list (including synonyms if enabled), otherwise \code{FALSE}.}
}
}
\description{
Matches reported station names in your dataset against a curated station list
(\code{"station.txt"}), which is synced with "Stationsregistret":
\url{https://stationsregister.miljodatasamverkan.se/}.
}
\details{
This is useful for validating station names and identifying any unmatched
or misspelled entries.

If \code{try_synonyms = TRUE}, unmatched station names are also compared
against the \code{SYNONYM_NAMES} column in the station database, splitting
multiple synonyms separated by \code{<or>}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
stations <- c("ANHOLT E", "BY5 BORNHOLMSDJ", "STX999")
match_station(stations, try_synonyms = TRUE)
}
