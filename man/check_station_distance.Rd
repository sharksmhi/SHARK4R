\title{Check station distances against SMHI station list}
\usage{
check_station_distance(names, station_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{Character vector of station names to check.}

\item{station_file}{Optional path to a custom station file (tab-delimited).
If \code{NULL} (default), the function will extract and use the bundled
\code{"station.zip"} from the \code{SHARK4R} package.}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\describe{
\item{reported_station_name}{The input station names.}
\item{match_type}{Logical; \code{TRUE} if the station was found in the SMHI station list, otherwise \code{FALSE}.}
}
Messages are issued if unmatched stations are found, or if matched stations
are suspected to fall outside distance limits.
}
\description{
Matches reported station names against the SMHI curated station list
(\code{"station.txt"}) and checks whether matched stations fall within
pre-defined distance limits. This helps ensure that station assignments
are spatially consistent.
}
\examples{
stations <- c("ANHOLT E", "STX999")
check_station_distance(stations)
