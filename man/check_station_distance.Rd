\title{Check station distances against SMHI station list}
\usage{
check_station_distance(
  data,
  station_file = NULL,
  plot_leaflet = FALSE,
  try_synonyms = TRUE,
  fallback_crs = 4326
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing at least the columns:
\code{station_name}, \code{sample_longitude_dd}, \code{sample_latitude_dd}.}

\item{station_file}{Optional path to a custom station file (tab-delimited).
If \code{NULL} (default), the function will extract and use the bundled
\code{"station.zip"} from the \code{SHARK4R} package.}

\item{plot_leaflet}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, displays a leaflet map with
SMHI stations (blue circles with radius in popup) and reported stations
(green/red/gray markers). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{try_synonyms}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), unmatched station
names are also compared against the \code{SYNONYM_NAMES} column in
the station database.}

\item{fallback_crs}{Integer; CRS (EPSG code) to use when creating spatial
points if no CRS is available. Defaults to \code{4326} (WGS84). Change this
if your coordinates are reported in another CRS (e.g., \code{3006} for
SWEREF99 TM).}
}
\value{
If \code{plot_leaflet = FALSE}, returns a data frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{station_name}{Reported station name.}
\item{match_type}{\code{TRUE} if station matched in SMHI list, \code{FALSE} otherwise.}
\item{distance_m}{Distance in meters from reported station to matched SMHI station.}
\item{within_limit}{\code{TRUE} if distance <= allowed radius, \code{FALSE} if outside, \code{NA} if unmatched.}
}

If \code{plot_leaflet = TRUE}, the function also produces a leaflet map
(returned invisibly). SMHI station popups include both the station name
and allowed radius.
}
\description{
Matches reported station names against the SMHI curated station list
(\code{"station.txt"}) and checks whether matched stations fall within
pre-defined distance limits. This helps ensure that station assignments
are spatially consistent.
}
\details{
Optionally, a leaflet map of stations can be plotted. SMHI stations that
match the reported data are shown as blue circles, with their allowed
radius visualized and displayed in the popup (e.g., "ST1 (Radius: 1000 m)").
Reported stations are shown as markers colored by whether they fall within
the radius (green), outside the radius (red), or unmatched (gray).

If \code{try_synonyms = TRUE}, the function will attempt a second match
using the \code{SYNONYM_NAMES} column in the station database, splitting
multiple synonyms separated by \code{<or>}.
