\title{Determine if Positions are Near Land}
\usage{
positions_are_near_land(
  latitudes,
  longitudes,
  distance = 500,
  shape = NULL,
  source = "ne",
  crs = 4326,
  remove_small_islands = TRUE,
  small_island_threshold = 2e+06,
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{latitudes}{Numeric vector of latitudes for positions.}

\item{longitudes}{Numeric vector of longitudes for positions. Must be the same length as \code{latitudes}.}

\item{distance}{Buffer distance (in meters) from the coastline to consider "near land." Default is 500 meters.}

\item{shape}{Optional path to a shapefile (\code{.shp}) containing coastline data. If provided,
this file will be used instead of the default Natural Earth 1:10m land vectors.
A high-resolution shapefile can improve the accuracy of buffer distance calculations.
Alternatively, you can retrieve a more detailed European coastline automatically by
setting the \code{source} argument to \code{"eea"}.}

\item{source}{Character string indicating which default coastline source to use when \code{shape = NULL}.
Options are \code{"ne"} (Natural Earth, default) and \code{"eea"} (European Environment Agency).
Ignored if \code{shape} is provided.}

\item{crs}{Coordinate reference system (CRS) to use for input and output.
Default is EPSG code 4326 (WGS84).}

\item{remove_small_islands}{Logical indicating whether to remove small islands from
the coastline. Useful in archipelagos. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{small_island_threshold}{Area threshold in square meters below which islands
will be considered small and removed, if remove_small_islands is set to \code{TRUE}. Default is 2 square km.}

\item{plot}{A boolean indicating whether to plot the points, land polygon and buffer. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
If \code{plot = FALSE} (default), a logical vector is returned indicating whether each position
is near land or not, with \code{NA} for positions where coordinates are missing.
If \code{plot = TRUE}, a \code{ggplot} object is returned showing the land polygon, buffer area,
and position points colored by their proximity to land.
}
\description{
This function is a \strong{wrapper/re-export} of
\code{iRfcb::ifcb_is_near_land()}. The \code{iRfcb} package is only required
if you want to actually call this function.
}
\details{
Determines whether given positions are near land based on a land polygon shape file.
The Natural Earth 1:10m land vectors are included as a default shapefile in \code{iRfcb}.

This function calculates a buffered area around the coastline using a polygon shapefile and
determines if each input position intersects with this buffer or the landmass itself.
By default, it uses the Natural Earth 1:10m land vector dataset.

The EEA shapefile is downloaded from \url{https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-coastline-for-analysis-2/gis-data/eea-coastline-polygon}
when \code{source = "eea"}.
